- Tired of doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.......Yup me too.

- From now on this script will do the hard work & we'll relax & enjoy our drink.

- This tool is for my requirements. Run it according to your needs. Also if you're a bug bounty hunter or web app pentester check out my this [tool](https://github.com/Aviksaikat/Bug-bounty-essentials) which installs all the necessary scripts you need a tester.

## Usage
